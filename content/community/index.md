title: The Galaxy Community
---
A vibrant community of contributors is the reason this project exists. The [Galaxy team](/src/galaxy-team/index.md) alone cannot possibly [maintain enough servers](/src/use/index.md), [wrap enough tools](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/), [teach enough workshops](/src/events/index.md), implement [all needed features](https://github.com/galaxyproject), or [answer every question](/src/support/index.md) on its own. This is why community is vital to our core mission - enabling reproducible research in data-rich sciences and beyond. Members within the Galaxy community are located all around the world and often form subgroups that differ in size (small versus large) and degree of privacy (public versus private). This page highlights these groups.

# Galaxy Community Conferences

<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 16rem;" src="/events/gcc2021/gcc2021-logo-wide-trans.png">

In 2010 the National Science Foundation initiated a yearly gathering of Galaxy users and developers by providing the project with a grant supplement. Since then this gathering has grown into an annual event known as the **[Galaxy Community Conference (GCC)](/src/gcc/index.md)**. GCC alternates between North America and elsewhere, and provides a forum for sharing knowledge and building collaborations. There have been over 200 participants every year since 2012.


# Working Groups and Project Governance

[Galaxy Working Groups](/src/community/wg/index.md) are how the community manages and contributes to key parts of the Galaxy ecosystem.  Working Groups were introduced in December 2020.  If you want to get involved with Galaxy in a significant way then we recommend joining a working group.

*Working Groups are a key component of the [Galaxy Governance Model](/src/community/governance/index.md), which also includes the [Galaxy Steering Committee](/src/community/steering/index.md) and the [Galaxy Exec](/src/community/exec/index.md).*

# IUC: Keepers of Galaxy Tools

The [Intergalactic Utilities Commission](/src/iuc/index.md) (IUC) was established in 2012 to enable the pervasive use of the main Galaxy Tool Shed by ensuring the repositories available include contents that are functionally correct and optimized for installation into local Galaxies.  When appropriate, the group provides guidance to Galaxy tool developers so that they can improve the quality of their repositories.

**Activities**

* Maintains a set of high quality Galaxy tools in the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc). This repo serves as an excellent example and inspiration to all Galaxy tool developers.
* Cultivates and shares the Galaxy tool development best practices [document](http://galaxy-iuc-standards.readthedocs.io/).
* Provides support to tool developers on a public Gitter [channel](https://gitter.im/galaxy-iuc/iuc).


# Galaxy Training Network

The [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) is a [network of people](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame) that create and maintain a [large library of Galaxy and Galaxy-based training materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/). This material can be used in training and education settings, or used in stand-alone, self-paced training.  It's a good way to learn bioinformatics and Galaxy.


# Conda and Bioconda

<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 15rem;" src="/src/images/logos/bioconda_64.png" alt="Bioconda" />

[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) is an open source package management system that is heavily used by Galaxy to manage tool dependencies and installations. [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) is a specific channel for Conda that distributes popular bioinformatics software, many of which have been wrapped by the Galaxy community.


# Galaxy Developer Roundtable

<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 8rem;" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/galaxy-developer-roundtable-300.png" alt="Galaxy Developer Round Table" />

[This group](/src/community/devroundtable/index.md) meets every other Thursday.  It's an opportunity for presenters (Galaxy users, developers, admins) to engage with the Galaxy developer community interactively.  These are lightweight and informal gatherings, and are cancelled if no one volunteers to present.

Anyone is welcome to attend. If you would like to present, please [fill out this form](https://bit.ly/gxdevroundtablepresent) by midday Wednesday of that week.
