comments:
  - "InteractoMIX features a set of tools designed to address two major aspects in the study of protein-protein interactions (PPIs)"
  - "i. What proteins interact. That is, the study of PPIs as a network of interactions including integration of interactomics data, characterization, prediction and application to drug discovery."
  - "ii. How proteins interact. That is, the structural details of PPIs, including characterization of protein interfaces, prediction of sites, docking and peptide design."
