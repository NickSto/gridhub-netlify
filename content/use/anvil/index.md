quotas:
  - "AnVIL is classified as both an *academic cloud* and a *commercial cloud* platform.  It is definitely a *research cloud* platform (funded [by NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Computational-Genomics-and-Data-Science-Program/Genomic-Analysis-Visualization-Informatics-Lab-space-AnVIL#awards)), but it is built on a *commercial cloud* platform and is a pay-per-use platform."
