summary: "Machine learning-based analysis and classification of adaptive immune receptors and repertoires (AIRR)."
image: "immuneml-logo.png"
comments:
  - "immuneML is an open-source collaborative ecosystem for machine learning-based (ML) analyses of adaptive immune [receptors](https://docs.immuneml.uio.no/galaxy/galaxy_simple_receptors.html) and [repertoires](https://docs.immuneml.uio.no/galaxy/galaxy_simple_repertoires.html) (AIRR)."
  - "Does not assume previous knowledge of machine learning."
  - "immuneML enables the ML study of both experimental and synthetic AIRR-seq data that are labeled on the repertoire-level (e.g., immune state, sex, age, or any other metadata) or sequence-level (e.g., antigen binding), all the way from preprocessing to model training and model interpretation."
  - "The core functionality is available in two tool interface forms: one form based on intuitive selection boxes, and a second form allowing full control of all analysis details by providing a [yaml-based analysis specification](https://docs.immuneml.uio.no/specification.html)."
  - "immuneML’s compliance with AIRR community software and sequence annotation standards ensures straightforward integration with third-party tools for AIRR data preprocessing and AIRR ML results’ downstream analysis, several of which are already integrated at the Galaxy server."

quotas:
  - "The Galaxy interface is intended to make it easy for users to try out immuneML quickly, but for large-scale analyses, please [install immuneML](https://docs.immuneml.uio.no/installation.html) locally or on a private server. (It is available as a Docker image.)"
