## Adding a news item

To add a news item, create a new folder in [https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/tree/master/src/news](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/tree/master/src/news) with an 'index.md' file. It's probably easiest to copy the format from one of the other existing news items as a template.
