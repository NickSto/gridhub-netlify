The [January Papercuts CoFest](/src/events/2021-01-papercuts/index.md) offered prizes for 10 randomly selected contributors from the event.

We are pleased to announce that these contributors will receive a free calendar featuring 14 stunning and high-resolution pictures of living things from across the tree of life. The calendars also list several Galaxy events throughout the year.

The winners are:

* Catherine Bromhead, University of Melbourne
* Helena Rasche, ErasmusMC
* Anthony Bretaudeau, INRIA
* Oleg Zharkov, University of Freiburg
* Saskia Hiltemann, ErasmusMC
* Estelle Ancelet, INRIA
* And 4 people who have chosen to remain anonymous (perhaps to avoid the crowds that the calendars would draw during these pandemic times?)

Thanks to everyone who participated.  The [February Papercuts CoFest](/src/events/2021-02-papercuts/indesx.md) is on Thursday, Feburary 25.  We aren't offering prizes in February, but they will return in the future.

Hope to see you at future events!
