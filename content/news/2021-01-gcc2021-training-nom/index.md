The [2021 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2021)](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021) will be held July 5-12, 2021 in Ghent, Belgium. Like other years, the conference will feature training workshops throughout the event. **The training topics that are offered are determined by you**.

Please note that given the COVID-19 pandemic it is currently unclear whether GCC will be able to proceed as a face to face meeting in Belgium, or if it will go virtual again like last year.

We are [soliciting topic nominations for training sessions at GCC2021](https://tinyurl.com/gcc2021-topic-nomination). Whether you are a teacher nominating a topic you would like to teach at GCC, or a participant who would like to attend a workshop to learn more about certain topics, [this form](https://tinyurl.com/gcc2021-topic-nomination) is for you!

After the nomination period, we will open voting on nominated topics to the Galaxy community, and use this community feedback to create the training programme for GCC2021.

For ideas for nominations, please look at the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN) tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/)

If any of these tutorials look interesting to you, please provide the tutorial names, and the topic they are a part of, in the form. If you would like to nominate other topics that are not (yet) part of the GTN, that is also possible!

NOTE: Nominations will be open until January 29th, 2021.

Nominated topics will be added to [this page](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training/) within a few days.

Thanks for helping to make GCC2021 a success!<br />
