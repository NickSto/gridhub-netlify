This is a followup to discussion to the [December 2020 roundtable](/src/events/2020-12-10-dev-roundtable/index.md), where [Galaxy Working Groups](/src/community/wg/index.md) were launched.  Galaxy Working Groups are a major shift in how Galaxy Project work and direction are managed.

This call will be a followup to see how our first month has gone, and how goal setting and tracking fro 2021Q1 is going.

If you are interested and are potentially willing to contribute some of your time and effort to helping the global Galaxy effort, then please attend this roundtable.  If you can't make it, the gathering will be recorded and published shortly after the event.

Please **[join us](https://psu.zoom.us/j/92752763386)** at Noon, US Eastern time ([see in your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Galaxy+Developer+Roundtable&iso=20210107T12&p1=179&ah=1)).
