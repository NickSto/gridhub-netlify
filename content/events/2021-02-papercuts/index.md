*Paper cuts are annoying but easy to fix bugs. [Paper cuts CoFests](/src/events/cofests/papercuts/index.md) are virtual, global, day-long events that improve the Galaxy ecosystem by addressing these issues, and by onboarding new contributors in the Galaxy community.*

**The February 2021 Papercuts CoFest will be held concurrently with the [Galaxy Training Network day](/src/events/2021-02-gtn/index.md)**, which like Papercuts is a CoFest featuring community calls throughout participating time zones.  You are encouraged to participate in both.

Want to improve Galaxy, and get involved with Galaxy? Please join us on February 25.

**Goals**

* Make the Galaxy experience be a pleasure and be productive by removing and reducing irritants.
* Grow the Galaxy contributor community by holding regular events.
* Identify easy but informative things to fix.
* Work together and enjoy the community.
* Dedicate time together for bug-fixing.
* Make reducing paper cuts fun.

This will be a 24h event, spanning all time zones with our worldwide community. We'll start at 09:00 Melbourne time, and end at 15:30 Portland time.

The February Papercuts has a new emphasis on [helping students get involved with Galaxy](/src/events/cofests/papercuts/index.md#papercuts-for-students), a global open source / open science project. This month we are particularly reaching out to people at these universities:

* [James Cooke University](https://www.jcu.edu.au/), Townsville, Cairns & Brisbane, Australia
* [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/), Edinburgh, United Kingdom
* [Lock Haven University](https://lockhaven.edu/), Lock Haven & Clearfield, Pennsylvania, United States.

Don't worry if you aren't at one of these universitites. You should still join us, and we will get you on board.  (And we'll also talk to you about bringing your uni on board next month.)

## Developer Quick Dive Videos

[Developer Quick Dives](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFLKDpdM3B8Ro-V0mZboQjj40RimRZ8n) are short videos (2 minutes or less) that demonstrate how to do common tasks in Galaxy development.  Take a peek.


### Before the event

If you are a Galaxy user or admin, you can create, or tag existing GitHub issues for any irritating, but likely easily fixed bugs (make a guess). These can be in any part of Galaxy, not just the core engine, and includes training, documentation, and other software.

If you don't have a GitHub or Gitter account yet, then set them up (in that order).

If you have time, and want to learn more about contributing you are encouraged to review:

* [A collection of short videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFLKDpdM3B8Ro-V0mZboQjj40RimRZ8n), highlighting how to do common useful tasks during Paper Cuts and beyond.
* [Development in Galaxy tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/).
* [Contributing to the Galaxy Training Material tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/contributing/).
* [Galaxy on GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject) - see what projects are supported and find the one that speaks to you. Pay particular attention to each project's CONTIBUTING.md files.

### During the event

We will have video calls throughout the day and be on Gitter for chat all day long. Please take advantage of both to communicate with your collaborators around the world.

### After the event

*Get those pull requests in! And address anything from the review! And become more involved in the Galaxy code, training, and documentation base!*
