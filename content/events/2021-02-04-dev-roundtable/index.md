**Topic: How to grow the Galaxy Developer community**: a discussion of a new Galaxy Developer Training Course, and other ways we can make it easier for new developers.

**Topic: Training Updates**: Experiences from [Galaxy Admin training](/src/events/2021-01-admin-training/index.md), Training at GCC2021, and maybe offering a developer training track at GCC2021 too.

**Please [join us](https://psu.zoom.us/j/92752763386) at Noon, US Eastern time ([see in your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Galaxy+Developer+Roundtable&iso=20210204T12&p1=179&ah=1))** for an open discussion.

We are hoping to offer a new *Galaxy Developer Training Course* in 2021.  We hope to gather input on what should be covered, as well as insights on how this should be presented.  In addition, we would like to discuss other ways to make it easier for new code contributors to come on-board.

We'll also be discussing what we learned at the recently completed Admin training, and training (possibly including dev training!) at GCC2021.

Please bring your ideas.

The [Galaxy Developer Roundatble](/src/community/devroundtable/index.md) meets every other Thursday as long as there are [one or more presenters signed up for the week](https://bit.ly/gxdevroundtablepresent).  These gatherings are an opportunity for presenters (Galaxy users, developers, admins) to interactively engage with the Galaxy developer community.
